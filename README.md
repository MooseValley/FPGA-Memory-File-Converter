# FPGA Memory File Converter

My Github for this project:
* https://github.com/MooseValley/FPGA-Memory-File-Converter

The source code, input data file, JAR file, etc are all here - but it is command line only, so you wont see any GUI app when you run it.

You can download a ZIP of everything by clicking the green "**Code**" button on the right, and selecting "Download ZIP".

After you extract the ZIP to a folder on your PC - e.g. c:\Java - open a command prompt and cd to that folder and type this to run the JAR:

c:\java>  java -jar Ep32Ram.jar
